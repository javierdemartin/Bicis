Heyo! 

• I did some internal work that I will hope will make it easier for me to ship things & deleted a whole bunch of code
• Added support for London & Paris (did you know Paris is one of the largest bike sharing systems in the world? My databases don't like that
• You can now donate through In App Purchases, this is the main income of the app and I am grateful whenever any of you make a donation
• Rebuilt the Settings page
• Data insights is now available for everybody this is a decision I hope help more users
