I have improved how the prediction graph is shown in big screens like iPads. Previously it was as wide as the screen. Now it's smaller and easier to read.

If you use this app on an iPad there are keyboard shortcuts available. Keep the Command key pressed to check all the available shortcuts.

Thank you to all of you that have unlocked all the features of the app <3
