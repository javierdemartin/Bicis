New features!

When selecting your destination station you can check the predicted docks that will be by calculating your estimated travel time. This can potentially avoid a surprise when arriving to a full station and no place to leave your bike. 

Just in case you will be shown the closest annotation that also has free docks.

More analysis is being performed in the backend to detect the predicted discharges and refill operations by the service managers.
