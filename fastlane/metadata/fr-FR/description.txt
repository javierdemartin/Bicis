Bike sharing shouldn't be as complex as it is. Get custom tailored demand predictions for each station based on recent usage. A complex backend that does data analysis creates new predictions on a daily basis so Neural Bikes is always up to date with the most recent data.

Not only prediction graphs are useful but also live demand history. Glance at the station's graph and compare the actual demand against the predicted values.

Take a glance at the insights view and get estimate values on future charges and discharges operations done by the service's operators.
