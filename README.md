Bike sharing services have an imbalance problem that's shared around the world. A simple search leads up to [different studies](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=balancing+bike+sharing+systems) that try to solve this problem in the best way that minimizes costs for the service manager and so the user's don't ever arrive to a full or empty station that can't be used.

This repository contains the code of the App Store app available for multiple cities around the world. All the data being used comes from the main repo linked below and shows users daily bike sharing demand predictions based on recent usage using custom neural networks trained specifically for each city.
