iOS app to check on the status of bike sharing services. Currently available for Bilbao, Madrid, New York, London & Paris. 

Compares the daily historic availability against the predictions made by [Neural Bikes](https://neuralbike.app). The predictions are handled and created by the Machine Learning backend, [Neural Bikes](https://github.com/javierdemartin/neural-bikes).

## Acknowledgements

This app is completely free. I even removed Google Ads because I didn't feel comfortable using them. I'm planning on adding donation buttons to the app to help me maintain the development of this project. Meanwhile you can contribute and donate via Ko-Fi using the button above.
